<p>Running benchmarks is an extremely difficult task to do correctly.
There are many, many factors to take into account; it is <em>not</em> as
simple as just compiling and running a stock benchmark application.
This documentation is by no means a definitive guide, but it does try
to offer some suggestions for generating accurate, meaningful
benchmarks.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Decide <em>exactly</em> what you are benchmarking and setup your system
accordingly.  For example, if you are trying to benchmark maximum
performance, then many of the suggestions listed below are
extremely relevant (be the only user on the systems and network in
question, be the only software running, use processor affinity,
etc.).  If you’re trying to benchmark average performance, some of
the suggestions below may be less relevant.  Regardless, it is
critical to <em>know</em> exactly what you’re trying to benchmark, and
<em>know</em> (not guess) both your system and the benchmark application
itself well enough to understand what the results mean.</p>
<p>To be specific, many benchmark applications are not well understood
for exactly what they are testing.  There have been many cases
where users run a given benchmark application and wrongfully
conclude that their system’s performance is bad — solely on
the basis of a single benchmark that they did not understand.  Read
the documentation of the benchmark carefully, and possibly even
look into the code itself to see exactly what it is testing.</p>
<p>Case in point: not all ping-pong benchmarks are created equal.
Most users assume that a ping-pong benchmark is a ping-pong
benchmark is a ping-pong benchmark.  But this is not true; the
common ping-pong benchmarks tend to test subtly different things
(e.g., NetPIPE, TCP bench, IMB, OSU, etc.).  <em>Make sure you
understand what your benchmark is actually testing.</em></p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are the <em>only</em> user on the systems where you are
running the benchmark to eliminate contention from other
processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that you are the <em>only</em> user on the entire network /
interconnect to eliminate network traffic contention from other
processes.  This is usually somewhat difficult to do, especially in
larger, shared systems.  But your most accurate, repeatable results
will be achieved when you are the only user on the entire network.</p></li>
<li><p>Disable all services and daemons that are not being used.  Even
“harmless” daemons consume system resources (such as RAM) and cause
“jitter” by occasionally waking up, consuming CPU cycles, reading
or writing to disk, etc.  The optimum benchmark system has an
absolute minimum number of system services running.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that processor and memory affinity are properly utilized to
disallow the operating system from swapping MPI processes between
processors (and causing unnecessary cache thrashing, for example).</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>On NUMA architectures, having the processes getting
bumped from one socket to another is more expensive in
terms of cache locality (with all of the cache
coherency overhead that comes with the lack of it)
than in terms of memory transfer routing (see below).</p>
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Be sure to understand your system’s architecture, particularly with
respect to the memory, disk, and network characteristics, and test
accordingly.  For example, on NUMA architectures, memory accesses
may be routed through a memory interconnect; remote device and/or
memory accesses will be noticeably slower than local device and/or
memory accesses.</p></li>
<li><p>Compile your benchmark with the appropriate compiler optimization
flags.  With some MPI implementations, the compiler wrappers (like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mpicc</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mpifort</span></code>, etc.) add optimization flags
automatically.  Open MPI does not.  Add <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-O</span></code> or other flags
explicitly.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your benchmark runs for a sufficient amount of time.
Short-running benchmarks are generally less accurate because they
take fewer samples; longer-running jobs tend to take more samples.</p></li>
<li><p>If your benchmark is trying to benchmark extremely short events
(such as the time required for a single ping-pong of messages):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Perform some “warmup” events first.  Many MPI implementations
(including Open MPI) — and other subsystems upon which the
MPI uses — may use “lazy” semantics to setup and maintain
streams of communications.  Hence, the first event (or first few
events) may well take significantly longer than subsequent
events.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a high-resolution timer if possible —
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gettimeofday()</span></code> only returns millisecond precision (sometimes
on the order of several microseconds).</p></li>
<li><p>Run the event many, many times (hundreds or thousands, depending
on the event and the time it takes).  Not only does this provide
more samples, it may also be necessary, especially when the
precision of the timer you’re using may be several orders of
magnitude less precise than the event you’re trying to
benchmark.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Decide whether you are reporting minimum, average, or maximum
numbers, and have good reasons why.</p></li>
<li><p>Accurately label and report all results.  Reproducibility is a
major goal of benchmarking; benchmark results are effectively
useless if they are not precisely labeled as to exactly what they
are reporting.  Keep a log and detailed notes about the ‘’exact’’
system configuration that you are benchmarking.  Note, for example,
all hardware and software characteristics (to include hardware,
firmware, and software versions as appropriate).</p></li>
